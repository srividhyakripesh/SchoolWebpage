# SchoolWebpage
A website mainly to develop our front end skills!!!
Plan is to create a webiste for a school/university.
  1. Home,
    2. About us,
    3. Contact Us
    4. Student login page (no backend - when user clicks should be navigated to page)
    5. Teacher login
    6. Admin login
    7. We can also have a MOOCs for students with download links.
    We can have a carousal for scroll bar. A hit-list for how many time the page has been visited.
    We dont need backend for this, only proper navigation and error messages should be displayed correctly.
    We can use all the tags and contect that we learnt till now.
    
   It will be like a static webpage!! but hey all this is for us to learn new skills !!!! :)
