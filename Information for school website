Hello everyone, I have an idea for the collaborative Project!!
    Why don't we create a website for an unknown school/university, with pages like
    1. Home,
    2. About us,
    3. Contact Us
    4. Student login page (no backend - when user clicks should be navigated to page)
    5. Teacher login
    6. Admin login
    7. Results page
    8. Page to download/link on various student contents, like course materials and youtube videos.
    9. New student registration.
    10. Festzone and newsletter.
    11. Forms for collecting feedback.
    12. can also add cookies features.
    We can have a bootstrap carousal element for scroll bar which displays pictures.
    A hit-list for how many time the page has been visited.
    We dont need backend for this, only proper navigation and error messages should be displayed correctly.
    We can use all the tags and context that we learnt till now. 
    It is an old idea, but I think it will be good for collaborating with lots of students, we can also keep adding new features as well.
